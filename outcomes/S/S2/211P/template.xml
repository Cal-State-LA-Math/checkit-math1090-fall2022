    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        The county of Los Angeles wants to get an idea of how residents feel about the quality of the transportation option in the county. In order to get the information, the County Department of Transportation uses records of vehicle registered in the county from the Department of Motor Vehicles to randomly select 1,000 residents of the county to send them a questionnaire written in English, asking for them to reply to a variety of questions about the transportation option available in the county.</p>
    <p>
        Survey respondents were asked to decide to what degree they agreed with the following statements. The possible answer were "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neither Agree or Disagree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree".</p>
    
        <list>
            <item><p>The county has done a wonderful job providing excellent transportation options to county residents.</p></item>
            <item><p>There is sufficient parking in the county.</p></item>
        </list>
    <p>
        <m>{{sample}}</m> residents responded to the survey. <m>{{result_1}}</m>% of respondents said that they {{agree_1}} that there are sufficient transportation options available and <m>{{result_2}}</m>% said that they {{agree_2}} that there is sufficient parking.</p>

        <content><p>Does the above use a sampling frame? If so, what is the sampling frame?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>Yes there is a sampling frame being used. The sampling frame is vehicles registration</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>What is the sampling method used in the above scenario?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>The sampling method was a simple random sample or SRS</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>Looking at the sampling frame and the sampling method, would the sample be a valid sample or is it likely to be a bias sample? Explain why.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>The sample method is valid but the sampling frame is like to produce a bias sample</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>Identify potential sources of bias other then the sampling method from the information given and explain why they lead to bias (Only use the information given, do not speculate about information not provided).</p></content>
        <outtro><p>Only in English and/or the wording of the first statement.</p></outtro></knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>If the county did the survey again, would you expect that exaclty <m>{{result_2}}</m>% of respondents would {{agree_2}} that there is sufficient parking in the county? Why or why not?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>No, the exact same result would not be expected due to natural variability</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>Based on the results of this survey, can the county of Los Angeles be sure that they understand how residents feel about the quality of public transportation options that are available to them in the county?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>No, too much bias</p></outtro></knowl>
