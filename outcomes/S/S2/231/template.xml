    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        Moms for Liberty is an American political organization that is known for advocating against school curriculum that mention items such as LGBTQ+ rights and discrimination against groups due to race and ethnicity, as well as campaigning to ban from school libraries books that address gender and sexuality. Moms for Liberty wants to get an idea of what Americans think about school library book bans. They partnered with Newsmax to announce a web-based survey asking Newsmax viewers to respond to the survey about the book bans. Survey responders went to a link that was announced during Newsmaxâ€™s primetime news shows and also provided online on the homepage for Newsmax. The survey was available in English and {{language}}.</p>
    <p>
        Survey respondents were asked to decide to what degree they agreed with the following statements. The possible answer were "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neither Agree or Disagree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree".</p>
    
        <list>
            <item><p>Given that protecting our children from inappropriate influences is of utmost importance, banning books from schools that will tear our children down and make them doubt themselves is an extremely valuable step that should be pursued at all costs.</p></item>
            <item><p>Since extreme radicals are attempting to coerce our children into believing immoral things, we must be vigilant in observing the curriculum used to teach our students and contacting our schools to have them immediately remove any such offensive material.</p></item>
        </list>
    <p>
        <m>{{result_1}}</m><m>\%</m> survey respondents said that they {{agree_1}} with the statement "Given that protecting our children from inappropriate influences is of utmost importance, banning books from schools that will tear our children down and make them doubt themselves is an extremely valuable step that should be pursued at all costs." <m>{{result_2}}</m><m>\%</m> said that they {{agree_2}} with the statement "Since extreme radicals are attempting to coerce our children into believing immoral things, we must be vigilant in observing the curriculum used to teach our students and contacting our schools to have them immediately remove any such offensive material.".</p>
