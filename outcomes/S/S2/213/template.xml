    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        The Federal Reserve wants to get an idea of how Americans feel about the Economy. In order to get the information, the Fed partnered with Quinnipiac University to send a survey to 950 randomly selected U.S. Adults. Survey respondents completed the survey online using a code provided in the invitation. The survey was available in English and {{language}}.</p>
    <p>
        Survey respondents were asked to decide to what degree they agreed with the following statements. The possible answer were "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neither Agree or Disagree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree".</p>
    
        <list>
            <item><p>The US economy was absolutely trashed by the closures during the pandemic.</p></item>
            <item><p>The people responsible for taking care of the US economy have done a fantastic job setting it up to recover quickly.</p></item>
        </list>
    <p>
        <m>{{sample}}</m> residents responded to the survey. <m>{{result_1}}</m>% of respondents said that they {{agree_1}} that the US economy was absolutely trashed by the closures during the pandemic and <m>{{result_2}}</m>% said that they {{agree_2}} that the people responsible for taking care of the US economy have done a fantastic job setting it up to recover quickly.</p>
