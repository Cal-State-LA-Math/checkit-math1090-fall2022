        <p><em>The Scenario</em></p>
        <p>Amazon is trying to decide whether to put a new warehouse in a specific neighborhood of Los Angeles County. As part of their decision making, they need to have certain criteria met in a geographical neighborhood. For any neighborhood that Amazon considers, they will build a warehouse if at least 55% of the households within 50 miles of that neighborhood want same day delivery.</p>
        <p>Amazon does a survey of households in Los Angeles County within 50 miles of the specific neighborhood that is being considered. <m>{{s}}</m> households responded out of the <m>{{n}}</m> surveyed. <m>{{x}}</m> say that they order from Amazon and want the option of same day delivery.
        </p>
          <p>Conduct a hypothesis test using a 95% confidence level (Î±=0.05) to see if the survey provides evidence that supports Amazon building a warehouse in that neighborhood. You may use an app to do the test, if you wish. Include all work and screenshots of any app used. Use the results of your hypothesis test to answer the following questions.</p>
