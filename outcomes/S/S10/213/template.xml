        <p><em>The Scenario</em></p>
          <p>{{set_up}}</p>
          <p> They survey <m>{{n}}</m> {{pop_var}}, <m>{{s}}</m> of which responded to the survey. Of the respondents, <m> {{x}}</m> {{success}}</p>
          <p>The {{person}} claims that {{claim1}} {{direction}} <m>{{p0dec}}</m>%.</p>
          <p>Conduct a hypothesis test at a 95% confidence level (<m>\alpha = .05</m>) to test the claim made by the {{person}}. You may use an app to do the test, if you wish. Include all work and screenshots of any app used. Use the results of your hypothesis test to answer the following questions.</p>
