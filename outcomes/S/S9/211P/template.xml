        <em>The Scenario</em>
          <p>{{set_up}}</p>
          <p>
              They survey <m>{{n}}</m> {{pop_var}}, <m>{{s}}</m> of which responded to the survey. Of the respondents, <m>{{x}}</m> {{success}}
          </p>
        <p> Compute a <m>{{CL}}</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of {{prose}}. You may use an app to do the computations. You must show all your computations and/or a screenshot of any app used. Given answers in full sentences that include context where appropriate. Please use your work answer the following.</p>

    <knowl>
        <content><p>What is p-hat? Please give your answer exact to three decimal places.</p></content>
        <outtro><p><m>\hat{p}={{phat}}</m> p-hat is the sample proportion for a given scenario. In this case, the denominator of the proportion is the number of people who responded - <m>{{s}}</m>. The numerator of the proportion is given by the number of "successes". In other words, the number of people who {{success}}. In this case, that numerator is <m>{{x}}</m>. Dividing <m>{{x}}</m> by <m>{{s}}</m> and then rounding to three decimal places gives you <m>{{phat}}</m>. So the final answer would be something like "The proportion of respondents who {{prose}} is <m>{{phat}}</m>."</p> </outtro>

    <knowl>
        <content><p>What is the standard error for this interval? Please give your answer exact to four decimal places.</p></content>
        <outtro><p><m>SE={{SE}}</m> Recall that the standard error for an interval is calculated either by using the standard error formula for proportions, or, in our case, by using the appropriate app. If you choose to calculate the standard error using a calculator, you need to carefully show all your computations and be sure that you know how to take a square root on your calculator. Note that the standard error formula uses p-hat, not the number of successes or the number of respondents. A good way to notice if you are using the wrong numbers - using anything that is not between 0 and 1 will give you an error as you will end up trying to take the square root of a negative number. If you do use an app, be sure your screenshot includes your original input as well as the final output, including the formula output. </p></outtro>

        <content><p>What is the confidence interval? Please give your answer in proper interval format exact to four decimal places.</p></content>
        <outtro><p><m>[{{LB}}, {{UB}}]</m> Proper interval format uses brackets or parentheses to enclose the lower and upper bounds of the interval with a comma in between. An "interval" includes not only the end points but all the points in between. A confidence interval is a segment of the real number line in our course.</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>Put your interval into context of the scenario.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>With {{CL}}% confidence level, the proportion of {{prose}} is between <m>{{LB_p}}</m>% and <m>{{UB_p}}</m>%. The whole point of a confidence interval is that by using our sample proportion we can get an estimate of the actual population proportion to a certain degree of confidence. So we are "<m>{{CL}}</m> % confident that our actual population proportion is above the lower bound and below the upper bound". This is why the word "between" is critical in the answer.</p></outtro>

        <content><p>{{claim1}} {{direction}} <m>{{c}}</m>% {{claim2}}.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>The confidence interval {{claimtrue}} the claim. So how to you analyze whether or your confidence interval supports the claim? You need to look carefully at the claim and how the numbers in the claim relate to the numbers in the confidence interval. For example, if we have a {{CL}}% confidence interval of (0.2,0.4) for something and the claim is that the value is greater than or equal to 0.5, our interval does NOT support the claim. We are {{CL}}% confident that our population proportion is BETWEEN 0.2 and 0.4, so it is UNLIKELY to be greater than or equal to 0.5. On the other hand, if the claim was LESS THAN or equal to 0.5, then this interval would SUPPORT the claim between we are pretty sure the proportion is between 0.2 and 0.4, all of which is BELOW 0.5. It gets trickier to think about when the interval and the claim have crossover between them, but the interval is not entirely greater than or entirely less than the claim. In this case, we don't really know where within the interval the actual proportion is, so we CANNOT support the claim, as our evidence is inconclusive.</p></outtro>
