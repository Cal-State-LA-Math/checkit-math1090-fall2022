        <em>The Scenario</em>
          <p>With total gun-related deaths reaching new highs in recent years, growing shares of Americans view both gun violence and violent crime as very big national problems. </p>
        <p>In June 2023, the Pew Research Center sent a survey out to <m>{{n}}</m> U.S. adults. A total of <m>{{s}}</m> adults responded. <m>{{x}}</m> adults favor increasing the minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old.</p>
        <p> Compute a <m>{{CL}}</m><m>\%</m> confidence interval for the proportion of {{prose}}. You may use an app to do the computations. You must show all your computations and/or a screenshot of any app used. Please use your work answer the following.</p>
