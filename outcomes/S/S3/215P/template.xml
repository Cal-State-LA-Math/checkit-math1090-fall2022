        <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
        <p>
        A trial of the intravenous medication Remdesivir was conducted in {{age}}. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Remdesivir or a placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome measured was the time to recover. Preliminary results from the {{n}} patients ({{n_e}} randomly assigned to get Remdesivir and {{n_p}} to get the placebo) indicated that those who received Remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days as compared with {{diff}} days in those who received the placebo. {{results}}</p>
