        A new study suggests that "Pink Drinks can help you run faster and further." Researchers at the Center for Nutraceuticals in the University of Westminster investigated the effect of drink color on exercise performance. In this study, {{n}} active {{age}} were instructed to run for 30 minutes on a treadmill. Half of the participants used a pink drink to rinse their mouths during the run, the other half used a clear drink to rinse their mouths during the run. The drinks were artificially sweetened and identical except for color. The participants were randomized as to which drink they received. The researchers evaluating the performance of the runs {{blinding}}. Researchers noted the participants' choice of running speed, the distance covered during the run, and asked participants to rate their feelings of pleasure from the drink. {{results}}</p>
