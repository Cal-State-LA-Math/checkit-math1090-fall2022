        <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
        <p>
        A recent study examined whether meditation can be used to counter the impact of math anxiety. {{n}} {{age}} were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups were given information to read about why some people have math anxiety. Then, students in the first group completed a 5-minute meditation. Students in the second group did not do the meditation. Both groups then took a math test. The tests were graded by a math TA (not related to the researchers) {{blinding}}. The results were that students in the meditation group scored {{diff}}% higher that the students in the non-mediation group. {{results}}.</p>
