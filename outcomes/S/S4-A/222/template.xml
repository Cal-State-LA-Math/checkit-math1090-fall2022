        A critical component to our understanding of statistics is being able to read and understand graphs. It is also critical that we be able to look at graphs and identify any flaws they might have. Be sure to answer ALL the questions.

    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        In 2021, Asian American workers face the longest periods of joblessness and other labor challenges, despite having the lowest unemployment rate out of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. The chart below summarizes the median duration of joblessness for different racial groups, as well as the subgroups of race split by gender.</p>
