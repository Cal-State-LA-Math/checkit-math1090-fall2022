    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        One of the things that students who want to go to Medical School or Law School have to do is take a standardized test. The MCAT is required for admission to Medical school, the LSAT is required for admission to law school. These tests are called “standardized” because they are given in the same manner to all test takers and are graded in the same manner. Additionally, the scores are scaled to be normalized distributed.
       </p>
    <p>
        In 2019, the MCAT had a mean of 500.9 and a standard deviation of 10.6 and the LSAT had a mean of 150 with a standard deviation of 10. Please use this information to answer the questions below.
