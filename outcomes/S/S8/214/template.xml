    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        In many areas of medicine, there are different measurements used to define “healthy” based on gender, age, and race. One such measurement is bone density. Bone density is important, because as we age, bone density can decrease. If it decreases too much, we become at much higher risk of fractures.
       </p>
    <p>
        For example, for people aged 25, White Women have a mean bone density of 955 mg/cm^2 with a standard deviation of 123 and Black Women have a mean bone density of 1040 mg/cm^2 with a standard deviation of 135. Please use this information to answer the questions below.

        <content><p>Diane is a 25 year old woman whose bone density is <m>{{dep_5}}</m>. Which group is bigger - the proportion of Black women who have a bone density lower than Diane or the proportion of White women who have a bone density higher than Diane? Justify your answer using a statistical analysis.</p></content>
