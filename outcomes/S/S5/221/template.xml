        <p>Besides graphs, another way we summarize data and compare sets of data is though numerical summaries. Below you will find two tables of numerical summaries of different datasets. Use these tables to answer the questions below. Answer all questions completely and include contextual information in your answers. Show or explain all of your work and include screen shots of any applets you use. </p>
        <p>Our World in Data is a non-profit that has as its mission to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable. One of the areas that they collect and share data is the child mortality rate of counties around the world. Child mortality rate is the average amount of children that die before the age of 5 per 1,000 live births. So if a country had a child mortality rate of 2, that would mean that on average there were two children that die before their fifth birthday for every 1,000 live births in that country. The information below are the child mortality rates for countries around the world in the year 2020 for which data is available, split by male vs female children.</p>
