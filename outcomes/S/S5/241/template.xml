        <p>Besides graphs, another way we summarize data and compare sets of data is though numerical summaries. Below you will find two tables of numerical summaries of different datasets. Use these tables to answer the questions below. Answer all questions completely and include contextual information in your answers. Show or explain all of your work and include screen shots of any applets you use. </p>
        <p>A reporter for a newspaper is doing an article about the costs of attending college. She collects the total annual cost for an in-state student (including tuition, fees, housing, and meals) from 4-year institutions in California and Washington. The two data sets are summarized below:</p>
        <p>Average annual cost of college in California</p>
        <p><me>\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \text{ N } &amp;\text{ Min } &amp;\text{ Q1 } &amp;\text{ Median } &amp;\text{ Q3 } &amp;\text{ Max } &amp;\text{ Mean } &amp;\text{ St Dev } \\
            \hline

            \hline

        <p>Average annual cost of college in Washington</p>
