        <p>Besides graphs, another way we summarize data and compare sets of data is though numerical summaries. Below you will find two tables of numerical summaries of different datasets. Use these tables to answer the questions below. Answer all questions completely and include contextual information in your answers. Show or explain all of your work and include screen shots of any applets you use. </p>
        <p>Poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality: The world faces many great and terrifying problems. It is these large problems that our work at Our World in Data focuses on. Our World in Data is a non-profit that has as its mission to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable. The information below are the death rates from cancer for the countries of the world in 1996 and 2011 for which data is available.
