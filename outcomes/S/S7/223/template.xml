    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
         Home builders are often trying to decide what types of homes to build based on what they expect to sell. The US Census Bureau classifies housing into three types - single family homes, multi-family residential (homes with 2 to 4 units), and multi-family commercial (complexes with more than 5 units). Below is a summary of the number of new housing permits issued in 2022 in four geographic areas of the United states.
