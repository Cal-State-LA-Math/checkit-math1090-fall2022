      <em>Scenario:</em>
    </p>
    <p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual survey done by the US
    Census Bureau. Information from the survey generates data that help inform
    how trillions of dollars in federal funds are distributed each year. The
    ACS gathers a wide variety of data including information about whether
    American own or rent their homes, how they commute to work, what their
    employment status is, as well as dozens of other topics.</p>
    <p>One set of questions on the ACS is about how people commute to work. The
    data table below summarizes four methods of commuting, broken down into
    three age groups. Please use the table below to answer the questions
    listed.</p>
    <p>Use the table below to answer the questions. Make sure to show your
    computations and give your answers in full sentences with context from the
    scenario. Round your answer to four decimal places. Failure to show all
    computations or incorrect rounding may result in a score of "not
    mastered".</p>
