        <em>The Scenario:</em>
        <p>Below are two scatterplots, one showing the relationship between the price of a home in San Luis Obispo County in 2009 and the size of the home. The other is showing the relationship between the price of a home in San Luis Obispo County in 2009 and the number of bedrooms.</p>
        <p><image source="assets/S6/212_A.png" description="Scatter plot and regression line showing price vs it's size in square footage"/></p>
        <p>Below is the information about the regression model for the scatter plot above.</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Equation and R^2 value for the price of a home in San Luis Obispo County in 2009 vs the size of the home.</p></item>
            <item><p>Price = -113509.75 + 283.09 * (sqft)</p></item>
            <item><p>The R^2 value for this regression is .665</p></item>
        </list>

         <p>Below is the information about the regression model for the scatter plot above.</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Equation and R^2 value for the price of a home in San Luis Obispo County in 2009 vs the number of bedrooms.</p></item>
            <item><p>Price = 58885.19 + 103256.20 * (# of bedrooms)</p></item>
            <item><p>The R^2 value for this regression is .153</p></item>
        </list>
        <p>Use the two scatter plots and the given information about the regression models to answer the questions below.</p>

            <outtro><p>Price vs size is the better model to make predictions with because it has a higher R^2 value</p></outtro>
