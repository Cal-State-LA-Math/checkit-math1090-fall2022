        <em>The Scenario:</em>
        <p>In 2019, a group of researchers collected the data from a sample of 222 car models and looked at the impact of different characteristics of the cars on the MSRP (manufacturersâ€™ suggested retail price). They ran a regression analysis. The scatterplots and regression lines are shown below for MSRP vs HP (horsepower) and MSRP vs Engine size (in liters).

        <content><p>Which model, if any, would you use to predict the price of a car? Explain why your choice would be the best model to get an accurate prediction.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>MSRP vs HP is the better model to make predictions with because it has a higher R^2 value</p></outtro>

        <content><p>Would you use one of the regression models to predict the MSRP of a vehicle with an engine size of 3.2 liters? Why or why not?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>No, the model has a weak correlation.</p></outtro>

        <content><p>There is a dot at ({{point_4x}}, {{point_4y}}) on the MSRP vs horsepower graph. Explain what this dot represents in context of the study</p></content>
        <outtro><p>A specific car in the dataset with {{point_4x}} horsepower and a MSRP of ${{point_4y}} </p></outtro>

        <content><p>Compute the correlation coefficient, R, for the MSRP vs horsepower model. Explain the meaning of R in the context of the scenario.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>.7629, there is a strong positive relationship between horsepower and MSRP so as the horsepower goes up, on average so does the MSRP.</p></outtro></knowl>
