    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        The New York City government wants to get an idea of what NYC voters think about crime in the city. In order to get the information, the NYC city council sent a survey to 4500 random homeowners living in NYC. </p>
    <p>
        Survey respondents were asked to decide to what degree they agreed with the following statements. The possible answer were "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neither Agree or Disagree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree".</p>
    
        <list>
            <item><p>The extreme level of violent crime is the most urgent and critical issue facing NYC as city dwellers do not feel safe to leave their homes.</p></item>
            <item><p>The crimes against homeowners by roving bands of arrogant teens are way out of control and should be suppressed with all the force available to the valiant NYPD.</p></item>
        </list>
    <p>
        <m>{{sample}}</m> homeowners responded to the survey. <m>{{result_1}}</m><m>\%</m> of respondents said that they {{agree_1}} that the extreme level of violent crime is the most urgent and critical issue facing NYC as city dwellers do not feel safe to leave their homes and <m>{{result_2}}</m><m>\%</m> said that they {{agree_2}} that the crimes against homeowners by roving bands of arrogant teens are way out of control and should be suppressed with all the force available to the valiant NYPD.</p>
